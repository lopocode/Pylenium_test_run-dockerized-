# Pylenium_test_run-dockerized-

This project is aimed to use a new testing framework I discovered from a pretty cool developer Carlos Kidman (@ElSnoMan on GitHub).  The aim of this was to investigate test automation using python and a "Cypress like" automation framework using python was too cool to pass up. 

Here's the link to his full documentation: https://elsnoman.gitbook.io/pylenium/ . What I wanted to do with this document is point out some issues I had in setup as a python novice and also to highlight what my personal aims to accomplish.

This project's aim is to:

- Install, create and execute a test using Pylemium.io 
- Containerize that test project in Docker
- Using some neat functions described in the Pylenium gitbook to give a small look into the framework can do.

In the documentation's "Quick Start" page you get a good breakdown on the project direction/purpose and a great tutorial video on how to get started (here:https://youtu.be/li1nc4SUojo).
